if the script file is compressed, you should decompress it first
and before repacking, compress it back

for arc3, you need to get its index first before repack
the usage of packer: programme.exe output_new_archive_name .idx file (the org archive should be in the same directory)

if the script file is not compressed, you know what i want to say
don't compress them back before repacking

for this game, you need to use the unpacker patched by me

it's all, thank you!
